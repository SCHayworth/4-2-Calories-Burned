# Scope
Running on a particular treadmill you burn 4.2 calories per minute. Write a program that uses a loop to display the number of calories burned after 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes.

### SAMPLE RUN:

    You have burned 42.0 calories in 10 minutes!
    You have burned 63.0 calories in 15 minutes!
    You have burned 84.0 calories in 20 minutes!
    You have burned 105.0 calories in 25 minutes!
    You have burned 126.0 calories in 30 minutes!

# Pseudocode
    Set calories per minute constant = 4.2
    for each 5 minute increment starting at 10 and ending at 30
      multiply calories per minute by the number of minutes
      Display the current count and the current number of minutes
